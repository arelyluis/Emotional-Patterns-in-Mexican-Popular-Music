# About

This paper presents an unsupervised analysis of emotional patterns in popular lyrics in Mexico across seven decades. We introduce a corpus of 629 number-one hits, compiled from established sources starting in 1950. Our analysis includes lexical diversity, predominant emotion detection, and song characterization based on emotional profiles. For emotion detection, we use RoBERTuito, a BERT-based model trained for emotion classification in Spanish, to compute emotional scores for individual phrases. These scores are aggregated into statistical feature vectors representing each song across six emotions. Applying k-Means clustering, we identify three archetypal song categories and analyze their distribution over time. Additionally, we explore sequences of predominant emotions within songs, uncovering structural patterns in emotional expression.
